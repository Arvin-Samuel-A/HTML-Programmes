<p>There are a few commom symptons or signs through which we can know that our computer is infected. Those are :
<ol>
  <li><u><b>Slow computer</b></u>: One of the most common signs of malware is a slow computer. As mentioned above, pieces of malware can noticeably slow down your operating system, programs and bandwidth.</li>
  <li><u><b>Lack of storage</b></u>: Malware can eat up storage space, leaving little room for legitimate programs and files. If a plague of unfamiliar programs is slowing down your computer, search the programs’ names online to make sure malware hasn’t infected your device.</li>
  <li><u><b>Crashing or freezing</b></u>: Either technical problems or malware could cause regular computer crashes. Make sure that all your drivers are up to date and your programs are compatible with your hardware. If it’s not a hardware or software issue, malware might be causing your Blue Screen of Death.</li>
  <li><u><b>Pop-ups and unwanted programs</b></u>: Constant pop-ups or unfamiliar toolbars are one of the most annoying signs of malware. Don’t click on any pages or toolbars that pop up out of the blue — close out of the program and run your anti-malware software immediately.</li>
  <li><u><b>Spam</b></u>: If your coworkers mention that they’ve been receiving messages from you that you don’t remember sending, you’re likely a victim of malware. Caution them not to open any links or attachments within the messages.</li>
