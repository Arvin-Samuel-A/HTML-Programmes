<p>Malware enters our Computers in Various Ways. Let us see through which ways does Malware enters the Computers.</p>
<dl>
  <dt><b><u>1.Any Download Whatsoever</u></b></dt>
  <dd>Everyone downloads media, apps, browser extensions, and other files all the time. Cybercriminals use such downloads to insert malware.</dd>

  <dt><b><u>2.Illegal Content</u></b></dt>
  <dd>You should never download pirated content. Not only it is unethical, but it’s also risky too. But still downloading pirated torrents remains a popular online activity.</dd>

  <dt><b><u>3.Email Attachments</u></b></dt>
  <dd>Email attachments are one of the most dangerous forms of malware distribution. It can trick even the most security-conscious users, especially when criminals use social engineering techniques to make you believe the emails are from a trusted sender.</dd>

  <dt><b><u>4.Removable Media</u></b></dt>
  <dd>Hackers can also conceal malware in the firmware of USB or other drives. Since firmware is embedded deep in the device and used for the drive to operate, it makes it difficult to detect it.</dd>

  <dt><b><u>5.Free Software Downloads</u></b></dt>
  <dd>There’s no such thing as a free - particularly when it comes to the internet. By now, everyone knows Facebook isn’t really free. It harvests your data for advertising, among other uses. When it comes to companies offering free software, these risks run even higher.</dd>
